# The Rusty Bever

The Rusty Bever refers to my personal website & the software that powers it.
It's built using a Rocket web server as a RESTful backend & a frontend
consisting of Astro & Svelte.

## Motivation

I was largely inspired by [Jan-Lukas Else](https://jlelse.dev/)'s own site,
called GoBlog. I find his blog & site to be very interesting, and I just wanted
to create one of my own!

## Goals

My goal is to create my own blogging platform, with lots of little extra
features that I'll just add whenever I get a new idea.

- [ ] Blogging
- [ ] Microblogging (aka my own Twitter)
- [ ] RSS feeds for everything
- [ ] About me page/resume
- [ ] Auto-updating list of my Miniflux subscriptions
- [ ] Description of my my server/desktop/laptop setups
- [ ] Maybe a CLI client that I can use to write my blog posts
