# Roadmap

This file describes a general plan for the software, divided into versions.

## v0.1.0

### Summary

* Version 1 of backend API
* Read-only frontend (no login)

### Description

Version 0.1.0 will be the first deployable version. The goal is to replace my
current blog with an instance of v0.1.0. This includes developing a (basic) SDK
(probably in Python) that allows me to interact with my instance, or rather
just post stuff.

## v1.0.0

### Summary

* First stable release
* Base for all other releases

### Description

For me, a 1.0 release indicates that the project is stable and can be actively
and efficiently worked on. I basically just want to iron out any wrinkles from
the 0.1 release, so that I have a solid base to develop all other features on.
This will also allow me to better combine the development of this project with
my studies, as it can be properly planned and managed whenever I have the time.
Any other features won't appear in this file. Rather, they will be managed
using the milestones & issues on my Gitea instance.
